# AlliRater
## CEN3031: Intro to Software Engineering Semester Project

UF students can rate the meal they just had at the dining hall using AlliRater. Students can also access the current meal ratings for the particular dining hall that they want to go to in order to determine if they should spend the money and time to go there.
